# Interview challenge

This is a project made for a tech challenge required in an interview process.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) because it is the fastest and easiest way to start.
Typescript template is used.

## Things added

- Styled components
- [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/): This handle api requests, retries, cache, etc for me.
- [MSW](https://mswjs.io/): This is used to mock the API responses in tests

## Things not added

- i18n. I'd add it in a real project.
- Any font family, using the default one.
- Lint/code formatter. I think it's important in a real environment within a team, but not for this challenge.
- UI Components library. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
